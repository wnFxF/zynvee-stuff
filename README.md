before you do anything you're going to want to open the project in your code editor of choice, and search the entire project for "eden-windows". replace that with your windows user account name, and then save. the "services" folder must be in a folder called "ecs" on your desktop if you dont want to manually edit all the bat files

from there install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and install redis. you'll also need postgres.

the readme in [ccr0's economy simulator upload](https://github.com/ccr0/economy-simulator) is useful, alongside [meow2346's](https://github.com/meow2346/ECS) being useful as well.
